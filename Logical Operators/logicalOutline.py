#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
three = True
four = False
a = three and four 
print(a)


#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.
five = 5>3
six = 8>5
b = five or six 
print(b)

#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
seven = 5 == 6
c = not seven 
print(c)


#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

eight = 12
nine = 11
d = eght and nine
