#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

string = "string"
stick = "stick"
e = "string" + "stick"


#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

one = 201
two = 202
s = one + two

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

three = 202
four = 201
q = three - four

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

bu = 23.5
su = 24.5
g = bu - su

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

five = 12
six = 12
l = five * six

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

lol = "Ha"
seven = 4
p = lol * seven

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

eight = 8
nine = 7
u = eight / nine 

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

la = 1.2
ba = 3.2
x = la / ba

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

ten = 200
eleven = 120
m = ten % eleven

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

twelve = 1202
thirteen = 3606
t = twelve // thirteen

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

fourteen = 1212
fifteen = 1313
z = fourteen ** fifteen

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

product = lit[0] * list[1] * list[2]
