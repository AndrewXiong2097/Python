#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

One = 200
a = True
mango = "strawberry"
ang = 3.55
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

vara = 2230
varA = 2231

#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

ad = 3.52


ad = 3.22


#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

k = a

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second

kikalo = ["pizza", "playstationFour", "chessBoard"]
x = "playstationFour"



#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:

v = "Andrew"

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(ang)
