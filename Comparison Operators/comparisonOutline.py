This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

fa = "Mango"
Ma = "Mango"
x = "Mango" == "Mango"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

one = 23
two = 23
z = 23 == 23
print(z)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

four = 10
five = 5
c = 10 > 5
print(c)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

six = 23
seven = 28
v = 23 < 28
print(v)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

eight = 123
nine = x 
b = 123 >= x 
print(b)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

ten = 123
eleven = x 
n = 123 <= x 
print(n)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
